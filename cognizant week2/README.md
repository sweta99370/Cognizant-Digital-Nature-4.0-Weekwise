## Contents

### 1. Design Patterns
Location: `design patterns.docx`

This document contains hands-on exercises covering the most common design patterns in object-oriented software development.

#### Covered Patterns:
- Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- Factory Method Pattern: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
- Builder Pattern: Constructs complex objects step by step.
- Adapter Pattern: Integrates incompatible interfaces.
- Decorator Pattern: Adds responsibilities dynamically.
- Proxy Pattern: Controls access to another object.
- Observer Pattern: Allows observer objects to receive updates.
- Strategy Pattern: Selects algorithm behavior at runtime.
- Command Pattern: Encapsulates requests as objects.
- MVC Pattern: Separates model, view, and controller logic.
- Dependency Injection: Decouples class dependencies.

Each pattern includes:
- Scenario and explanation
- Implementation steps
- Java code files
- Sample output

### 2. Data Structures & Algorithms
Location: `Data Structure And Algorithm.docx`

This document includes practical problems demonstrating the application of data structures and algorithms to real-world systems.

#### Covered Problems:
- Inventory Management System using HashMap
- E-commerce Search Function using Linear & Binary Search
- Sorting Customer Orders using Bubble Sort & Quick Sort
- Employee Management using Arrays
- Task Management System using Singly Linked List
- Library Management System using Linear & Binary Search
- Financial Forecasting using Recursive Algorithm

Each problem includes:
- Scenario and analysis
- Design decisions
- Java implementation files
- Time & space complexity analysis
- Sample output
